# Heart_Disease_Prediction_ML
Machine Learning Project
ðŸ«€ Heart Disease Prediction - Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in a patient using machine learning techniques. It is built using a combination of Python, scikit-learn, and Flask for model training and deployment. The application allows users to input medical data and receive a prediction indicating the risk of heart disease.

âœ¨ Key Features:
User-friendly web interface for inputting patient data

Predictive model trained on real-world heart disease datasets

Real-time prediction using a deployed Flask backend

Clean and responsive frontend using HTML/CSS

ðŸ“Š Dataset Used:
UCI Heart Disease Dataset

Contains features like age, gender, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.

ðŸ¤– Technologies Used:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)

Jupyter Notebook for model development

Flask for backend API

HTML/CSS for frontend

Git & GitHub for version control and collaboration
